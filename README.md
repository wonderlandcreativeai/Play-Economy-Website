Logo and Branding
The Wonderland logo features a stylized "W" with a gradient from purple to pink to orange. This gradient should be incorporated throughout the design for brand consistency.

Visual Style
The overall aesthetic should be futuristic and high-tech, inspired by the image of a neon-lit cityscape with holographic displays. Use gradients, glowing effects, and translucent UI elements to create depth and visual interest.

UI Elements
Buttons: Rounded corners with subtle gradients
Input fields: Sleek, minimal design with animated focus states
Progress bars: Glowing, futuristic style
Modals: Semi-transparent with blur effect backgrounds
Imagery
Consider using a 3D animated character as a guide through the experience. The character should have a friendly, approachable appearance with large expressive eyes and a warm smile. Dress the character in bright, playful colors that match the brand palette.
